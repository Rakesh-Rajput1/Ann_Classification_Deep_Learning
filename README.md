## Live Demo  
[Customer Churn Prediction Live App](https://annclassificationdeeplearning-tcemkz2fptkfsafargh2cp.streamlit.app/)

ANN Classification - Deep Learning Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification model designed to predict customer churn based on various features such as demographics, account details, and activity history.

The project demonstrates how to:

Build a complete machine learning pipeline.

Handle categorical and numerical data with preprocessing.

Train and evaluate an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Deploy the final model using Streamlit for interactive predictions.
